          underperformed in North American theaters and polarized critics; some praised its thematic complexity and visuals, while others critiqued its slow pacing and lack of action. 
          The film's soundtrack, composed by Vangelis, was nominated in 1982 for a BAFTA and a Golden Globe as best original score. 
          Blade Runner later became a cult film, and has since come to be regarded as one of the greatest science fiction films.</p>
